# Fish Tank 3d
> (working title)

A virtual fish tank made in three.js using react-three-fiber. Started from the [vite typescript react template](https://vite.dev/).

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

The goal for this is to have an editor where you can make a fish tank, and then create an embed you can put on your website.
