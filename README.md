# Maya's Aquarium Maker 3D

### [Visit the live version!](https://aquarium3d.may.as)

A virtual fish tank made in three.js using react-three-fiber. Started from the [vite typescript react template](https://vite.dev/).

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

The goal for this is to have an editor where you can make a fish tank, and then create an embed you can put on your website.
